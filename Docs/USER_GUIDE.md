## Understanding ATS Scores

### What is an ATS Score?

An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) score measures how well your resume will perform when scanned by automated systems used by employers. NextGenCV uses a comprehensive 6-factor scoring algorithm.

### Score Components

Your ATS score (0-100) is calculated from:

1. **Keyword Match (30%)**
   - Measures how many keywords from the job description appear in your resume
   - Higher match = better score

2. **Skill Relevance (20%)**
   - Evaluates if your skills align with job requirements
   - Considers both technical and soft skills

3. **Section Completeness (15%)**
   - Checks if all standard sections are present
   - Verifies contact information is complete

4. **Experience Impact (15%)**
   - Assesses the quality of your experience descriptions
   - Looks for leadership indicators and scope

5. **Quantification (10%)**
   - Counts achievements with measurable metrics
   - Examples: percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes

6. **Action Verb Strength (10%)**
   - Evaluates the strength of verbs used in bullet points
   - Strong verbs: Led, Achieved, Developed
   - Weak verbs: Did, Made, Helped

### Score Interpretation

- **80-100**: Excellent - Resume is highly ATS-compatible
- **60-79**: Good - Minor improvements recommended
- **40-59**: Fair - Significant improvements needed
- **0-39**: Poor - Major revisions required

### Viewing Your Score

1. Open any resume

## Best Practices

### Resume Content

**Do**:
- Start bullet points with strong action verbs
- Include quantifiable metrics (numbers, percentages)
- Tailor your resume to each job description
- Keep it to 1-2 pages
- Use consistent formatting
- Proofread carefully

**Don't**:
- Use personal pronouns (I, me, my)
- Include photos (unless required in your country)
- Use tables or text boxes (ATS can't read them)
- Include references (provide separately if requested)
- Use fancy fonts or colors (for ATS submissions)

### Keyword Optimization

1. **Analyze the Job Description**:
   - Identify required skills
   - Note repeated keywords
   - Look for specific technologies or methodologies

2. **Natural Integration**:
   - Don't just list keywords
   - Use them in context
   - Include them in bullet points

3. **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**:
   - Don't repeat keywords excessively
   - Use variations (e.g., "JavaScript" and "JS")
   - Focus on relevance

### Version Management

1. **Create Versions Strategically**:
   - Before major changes
   - After optimization sessions
   - When tailoring for specific roles

2. **Use Descriptive Notes**:
   - Add notes to versions explaining changes
   - Note which job description was used
   - Track what worked and what didn't

3. **Compare Regularly**:
   - Compare versions to see what improved scores
   - Learn from successful optimizations
   - Identify patterns in effective changes

### ATS Optimization

1. **Use Standard Section Headings**:
   - "Work Experience" not "Employment History"
   - "Education" not "Academic Background"
   - "Skills" not "Core Competencies"

2. **Avoid ATS-Unfriendly Elements**:
   - Headers and footers
   - Multiple columns
   - Tables
   - Text boxes
   - Images or graphics

3. **Use Standard Fonts**:
   - Arial, Calibri, Georgia, Times New Roman
   - 10-12pt for body text
   - 14-16pt for headings

4. **Save in the Right Format**:
   - PDF for most applications
   - DOCX if specifically requested
   - Plain text for maximum compatibility
